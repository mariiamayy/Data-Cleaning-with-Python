This project focuses on data cleaning, a critical step in the data analytics workflow that ensures the dataset's accuracy, completeness, and readiness for analysis.
The primary goal is to prepare raw data for meaningful insights by identifying and addressing issues such as missing values, inconsistent formatting, and duplicate entries.  

In this project, the following skills and techniques were utilized:  
1. **Data Handling with Python**: Leveraging libraries like pandas and NumPy to manipulate and clean the dataset efficiently.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Inspecting data characteristics to identify inconsistencies and anomalies.  
3. **Data Imputation and Transformation**: Filling missing values, standardizing formats, and transforming data for consistency.  
4. **Error Detection and Resolution**: Identifying and correcting issues such as duplicates and irrelevant data points.  

This notebook exemplifies the importance of structured and systematic approaches to data cleaning, ensuring the dataset's reliability for downstream analysis and visualization.
